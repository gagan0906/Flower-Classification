# Flower-Classification

## Introduction
#### This is a deeplearning project which uses Keras to classify flowers which are divided into 5 classes. 
## Requirements
  1. Python 3.5+
  2. Keras
  3. Tensorflow for Keras backend 
  
#### NOTE: I have used non-GPU version of Tensorflow. You can use GPU version also.  

## How to run
  1. Install python 3.5+ (not tested on python 2.7+)
  2. Open cmd type
    ```
      pip install keras, tensorflow
    ```
  3. Create a new directory anywhere and type following in cmd
    ```
      git clone https://github.com/gagan0906/Flower-Classification/
    ```
  4. Open cmd in same directory and type
    ```
      python main.py
    ```
